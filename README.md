## [Project 01 : Supervised Learning , Finding Donors](#mokuji_0)

### Introduction 
In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model indivisuals' income using data collected from the 1944 U.S. Census.<br>
I will then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

### Skills used in this project
1. Exploring the Dataset
    - pandas, matplotlib

2. Preprocessing the Dataset
    - sklearn
    - logarithmic transformation, normalizationm one-hot encoding

3. Modeling
    - metrics (f-beta score)
    - Naive Predictor, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, AdaBoost
    - pipeline to train and predict models
    - model tuning(grid search, cross validation)

4. Evaluation
    - find features which are important to predict accurately.
